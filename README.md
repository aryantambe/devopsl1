## Prerequisites

- Docker installed
- Maven installed
- DockerHub account
- Docker Scout CLI (`docker scout version`)
- (Optional) Two machines or terminals to test trust enforcement

---

## Build and Run Locally

Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhruv-dosh/ImageVerification
````

Change directory
```bash
cd retail-app
````

Build the Spring Boot JAR
```bash
mvn clean install
````

Build Docker image
```bash
docker build -t ImageVerification:v1 .
````

Test the app locally
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 ImageVerification:v1
````

Visit: [http://localhost:8080/products](http://localhost:8080/products)

---

## Push to DockerHub

Login to DockerHub
```bash
docker login
```

Tag the image
```bash
docker tag ImageVerification:v1 <dockerhub_username>/ImageVerification:v1
```

Push the image
```bash
docker push <dockerhub_username>/retail-app:v1
```

## Enable Docker Content Trust DCT

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Generate a Signing Key (first time only)

Windows
```bash
$env:DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST = "1"
```

Linux
```bash
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
```

Generating Key
```bash
docker trust key generate KeyName
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Sign the Image and Push

```bash
docker trust sign <dockerhub_username>/ImageVerification:v1
```

```bash
docker push <dockerhub_username>/ImageVerification:v1
```
üîë You'll be asked to enter strong passphrases for:

* Your root key
* The repository key
* The signer key (keyName)

üìù These keys are stored securely under:
`C:\Users\<YourName>\.docker\trust\private\`

---

## Pull and Verify Signed Image on Another Machine

Enforce trust (Windows)
```bash
$env:DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST = "1"
```

Enforce trust (Linux)
```bash
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
```

Pull only if image is signed
```bash
docker pull <dockerhub_username>/retail-app:v1
```

‚úÖ If the image is not signed or tampered with, the pull will **fail**.
