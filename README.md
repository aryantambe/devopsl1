# DevOps Lab 2

This repository is created to submit DevOps lab assignments.

## Branch Structure

To maintain clarity and organization, please follow this branch structure when submitting assignments:

- **assignment/<assignment-number>-<your-name>-<prn>**: Create a new branch for each assignment you work on. For example:
  - `assignment/1-james-bond-007`
  - `assignment/2-jane-smith-001`

## Folder Structure

For each assignment, create a folder using the following naming convention:

- `Assignment-<assignment-number>-<your-name>-<prn>`

Inside this folder, add all your code and related files. For example:

```
Assignment-1-dhaval-051/
  ├── src/
  ├── package.json
  └── (other files...)
```

Place all your assignment code and resources inside this directory structure to keep submissions organized.

### Steps to Submit an Assignment

1. Create a new branch from `main` using the naming convention above. Please make sure to always checkout main before creating another branch to maintain a clean workflow.
2. Add your assignment files and commit your changes.
3. Push the branch to the repository.
4. Open a pull request to merge your branch into `main` .
